This paper studies the effect of education on people's health conditions. Normal OLS estimation is confounded by omitted variable bias, such as people's time preference and discount value for the future. So, instrument variables and two-stage least squares are applied. The instrument is the minimum number of years required before dropping from school. It varies at the state-year level. The outcome variable is the hours of sickness absence in 1968. The results do not show that education has a significant effect on health. But the insignificant effect could stem from the weak correlation between instruments and endogenous variables.
